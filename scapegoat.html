Throughout the week, several members missed meetings and didn't complete their research on time. The final presentation was disorganized and received a poor grade. When the teacher asked what went wrong, everyone was silent for a moment. Then, one student pointed at Mark, who was in charge of assembling the slideshow.</p>                 <p>"Mark finished the slideshow too late," she said. Quickly, the others agreed. They complained that Mark's slides were sloppy, ignoring that they had given him the information late. Mark became the <strong class="font-semibold text-slate-900">scapegoat</strong> for the team's failure. By blaming him, the other students avoided taking responsibility for their own lack of effort. Mark was an easy target because he was quiet, and it was simpler to blame the final product than to admit their collective failure.</p>             </div>         </div>      </div>  </body> </html>
