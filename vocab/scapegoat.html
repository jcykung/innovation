          A scapegoat is a person or group that is unfairly blamed for the
          mistakes, wrongdoings, or problems of others. The act of scapegoating
          allows the truly responsible parties to avoid blame and criticism by
          redirecting negative attention onto the innocent target.

          Reading in Context: The Failed Project
        </h2>
        <div class="space-y-4 text-slate-700">
          <p>
            A team of students was assigned a major history project. Throughout
            the week, several members missed meetings and didn't complete their
            research on time. The final presentation was disorganized and
            received a poor grade. When the teacher asked what went wrong,
            everyone was silent for a moment. Then, one student pointed at Mark,
            who was in charge of assembling the slideshow.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Mark finished the slideshow too late," she said. Quickly, the
            others agreed. They complained that Mark's slides were sloppy,
            ignoring that they had given him the information late. Mark became
            the
            <strong class="font-semibold text-slate-900">scapegoat</strong> for
            the team's failure. By blaming him, the other students avoided
            taking responsibility for their own lack of effort. Mark was an easy
            target because he was quiet, and it was simpler to blame the final
            product than to admit their collective failure.
